= CodePaste

Code sharing platform for collaborating amongst teammates.
This is similar to PasteBin. However, CodePaste provides an
API interface designed to be accessible locally.

== Installation and Getting Started

. Clone to local repo
. Install necessary dependencies

----
./mvnw install
----
[start=3]
. Build project and create Jar file

----
./mvnw clean package
----

=== Running Application Locally
Project can be started using

----
./mvnw spring-boot:start
----

And can be stopped with

----
./mvnw spring-boot:stop
----

=== Running Application With Docker

First ensure that you have Docker installed. See the following link for details

* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

Then create and start the containers using Docker Compose

----
docker-compose up
----

The container can be stopped with

----
docker-compose down
----

=== Testing

The application can be tested locally by running

----
./mvnw test
----

And with Docker, using the test config file

----
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
----

NOTE: There is a bug when testing with Docker due to the use of TestContainers in the integration tests.
As of now, tests are only able to be ran locally. I am currently working to resolve this issue.



== Code Snippets
You can specify if code snippets are meant to be restricted by setting the
number of views or time(in seconds) remaining. After either the views or
the time remaining is decremented to zero the code snippet is disabled and
deleted from the database. If the code snippet is initialized to zero for both
values then the code is set to unrestricted and will remain in the database
regardless of time in the database or number of views.

=== Snippets consist of
* (UUID) ID
* (LocalDateTime) Date -> Date uploaded
* (String) Code -> String value of the code uploaded
* (Integer) TimeRemaining -> Seconds remaining until code snippet is restricted from
viewing
* (Integer) Views -> Number of views remaining until code snippet is restricted from
viewing

== Web Interface
These are example calls to a web interface running at http://localhost:8889/code/new

./code/new/
* Web page allows the user to enter code into the provided input box and specify
if the code snippet is restricted by time or views

image:src/main/resources/images/newCode.png[]

./code/+{id}+
* Web page accepts a path variable of type UUID, which represents the id of an upload
* Will return a ResponseDTO if an upload with the provided id exists and the
code is still enabled. Otherwise it will
route you to the "error-404" page
* ResponseDTO consists of
** (LocalDateTime) Date -> date uploaded
** (Integer) Views -> Number of views remaining
** (Integer) Time -> Seconds remaining

image:src/main/resources/images/getCode.png[]

./code/latest/
* Web page fetches a list of the ten most recent uploads, in descending order
* List will only contain code snippets that do not have time or view restrictions

image:src/main/resources/images/latestUploads.png[]

== API Interface
These are example calls to an api running at http://localhost:8080

=== getCode Request
* Accepts a UUID path variable

----
GET /api/code/2608f2f3-cfb6-40ae-95bd-a2757bc90c25 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
----
=== getCode Response
* Returns the code snippet associated with the provided UUID id,
if any are found

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 190

{"id":"2608f2f3-cfb6-40ae-95bd-a2757bc90c25","code":"This is a test!","date":"2022/06/26 00:06:48",
"timeRemaining":0,"views":34,"viewRestriction":true,"timeRestriction":false,"enabled":true}
----
=== postCode Request
* Request body accepts a RequestDTO that consists of
** (String) Code -> String value of the code uploaded
** (Integer) TimeRemaining -> Seconds remaining
** (Integer) Views -> Number of views remaining

----
POST /api/code/new HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept: application/json
Content-Length: 49
Host: localhost:8080

{"code":"This is a test!", "time":55, "views":10}
----

=== postCode Response
* Returns a ResponseDTO that consists of
** (UUID) ID
** (String) Code -> String value of the code uploaded

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 70

{"id":"0436f45a-2308-4dd2-9f7d-28771280ec43","code":"This is a test!"}
----

=== getLatestUploads Request

----
GET /api/code/latest HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
----

=== getLatestUploads Response
* Returns a list of the ten most recently uploaded code snippets, in descending order
* List will only contain code snippets that do not have time or view restrictions

----
